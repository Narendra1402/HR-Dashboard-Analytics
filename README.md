HR dashboard analytics is a data visualization tool that enables HR professionals to track and analyze key human resources metrics and KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) in real-time. It provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of an organization's HR department and allows for better decision-making and strategic planning.

An HR dashboard typically includes graphical representations of various HR metrics such as headcount, turnover rate, recruitment metrics, employee engagement, performance metrics, compensation and benefits data, and more.

HR dashboard analytics help organizations to measure and monitor the effectiveness of their HR strategies and initiatives, identify potential areas of risk, and develop strategies to improve employee productivity, retention, and satisfaction. It can also help HR leaders to make informed decisions about resource allocation, budget planning, and talent management.

Overall, HR dashboard analytics provides a powerful tool for HR professionals to analyze data and make data-driven decisions that help organizations to achieve their business objectives.
